Of course they heard and suspected! They knew... and they were mocking my horror! Yes, I thought so and I think so today! But anything was preferable to that agony! Anything would be more tolerable than that scorn! I couldn't stand their hypocritical smiles any longer!

Get those boards up! There... there! Where his horrible heart is beating!"
